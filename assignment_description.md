# Assignment 2: Group Programming Project
**School**: University College Dublin
**Module**: COMP 30220, Distributed Systems
**Professor**: Rem Collier
**Semester**: Autumn 2015

This assignment is a team programming project. You should organise yourselves
into teams of 2-4 members. The objective of the assignment is to develop a
distributed system using the technologies covered in the course. You have
freedom to choose what type of system you want to build.

## Team members
* [brettji](https://github.com/brettji)
* [jonrh](https://github.com/jonrh)
* [zyifei](https://github.com/zyifei)

## Key Deliverables
* **Initial Project Specification (2 pages)**: This should contain a description
of the system you aim to develop. It should highlight what technologies you
intend to use, give an initial system architecture; and clearly identify who
will be responsible for which parts of the project.
* **A Prototype Application**: This is the system you have developed. The
emphasis here is on it being a prototype system (it does not need to be
"polished" application) and specifically, it should clearly demonstrate you
understanding of the techniques covered in the course.
* **A Design Document**: This document should summarise the design of your
prototype application. It should clearly identify the system architecture; and
explain key components of the developed system. The **single docuent** will be
written by **all members of the team**.
* **Presentation / Demonstration**: At the end of the semester, you will be
required to make a group presentation. This presentation will include a 10
minute talk by the team and a 5 minute demonstration of the prototype
application.
